  <h1>About Oakline</h1>
  <p>
    Oakline is a small clothing brand built in Okotoks, we focus on clean graphics, and pieces
    that feel good now and still look good in 10 years.
  </p>
  <p>
    We focus on heavier fabrics, simple designs, and a calm, old-money aesthetic — the kind
    of stuff you can wear to school, out, or on a trip and never feel out of place.
  </p>
  <p>
    Every drop is small. Once pieces are gone, they’re gone.
